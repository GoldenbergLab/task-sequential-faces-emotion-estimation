# Sequential Collective Emotion Estimation Task

The goal of this task is to examine how people evaluate the mean emotional response of groups after seeing multiple emotional expressions which are presented sequentially.

Participants see 12 faces that appear on the screen for 0.5 second each. Faces are either all positive or negative. They are then asked to evaluate the mean emotional response of the faces on a scale.
